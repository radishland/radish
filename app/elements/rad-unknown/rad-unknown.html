<template shadowrootmode="open">
  <p>
    An unknown element is a reusable snippet without an associated custom
    element
  </p>
  <p>
    Directives can be bound dynamically: <span textContent="h2"></span>
  </p>
  <p>
    This means that the binding doesn't need to be defined at the component
    level, but can be defined at the page level.

  <button on:click="say">say</button>
